# Plans & Pricing

For costs and more information on pricing, visit [Zed's pricing page](https://zed.dev/pricing).

Zed works without AI features or a subscription. No [authentication](../authentication.md) is required for the editor itself.

## Zed Free {#free}

The editor is free with no time limit. AI features (hosted models and Edit Predictions) are not included in the Free plan.

## Zed Pro {#pro}

Zed Pro includes access to all hosted AI models and Edit Predictions. The plan includes $5 of monthly token credit. A trial of Zed Pro includes $20 of credit, usable for 14 days.

For details on billing and payment, see [Individual Billing](./billing.md).

## Zed Business {#business}

<!-- TODO: confirm per-seat pricing before launch -->

Zed Business gives every member full Zed Pro access, plus org-wide controls for administrators: which AI features are available, what data leaves your organization, and how AI spend is tracked. All seats and AI usage are consolidated into a single invoice.

For a full feature overview, see [Zed Business](../business/overview.md). For billing details, see [Organization Billing](../business/org-billing.md).

## Student Plan {#student}

The [Zed Student plan](https://zed.dev/education) includes $10/month in token credits, available free for one year to verified university students.

## Usage {#usage}

Usage of Zed's hosted models is measured on a token basis, converted to dollars at the rates listed on [the Models page](./models.md) (list price from the provider, +10%).

Monthly included credit resets on your monthly billing date. To view your current usage, visit your account at [dashboard.zed.dev/account](https://dashboard.zed.dev/account). Usage data from our metering provider, Orb, is embedded on that page.

## Spend Limits {#usage-spend-limits}

At the top of [the Account page](https://dashboard.zed.dev/account), you'll find an input for `Maximum Token Spend`. The dollar amount here specifies your _monthly_ limit for spend on tokens, _not counting_ the $5/month included with your Pro subscription.

The default value for all Pro users is $10, for a total monthly spend with Zed of $20 ($10 for your Pro subscription, $10 in incremental token spend). This can be set to $0 to limit your spend with Zed to exactly $10/month. If you adjust this limit _higher_ than $10 and consume more than $10 of incremental token spend, you'll be billed via [threshold billing](./billing.md#threshold-billing).

Once the spend limit is hit, we'll stop any further usage until your token spend limit resets.

> **Note:** Spend limits are a Zed Pro feature. Student plan users do not currently have the ability to configure spend limits; usage is capped at the $10/month included credit.

## Trials {#trials}

Trials automatically convert to Zed Free when they end. No cancellation is needed to prevent conversion to Zed Pro.
